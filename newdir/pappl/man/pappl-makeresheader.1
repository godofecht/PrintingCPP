.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pappl-makeresheader
creates a C header file suitable for inclusion in a printer application.
The header file creates a C unsigned char array or string constant that can be used with the
.B papplSystemAddResourceData
or
.B papplSystemAddResourceString
functions, or as data for a printer icon in the
.B pappl_icon_t
structure.
The C variable names used for each file are generated by replacing all spaces, dots, and dashes with the underscore.
For example, a file named "my printer-icon.png" would have the C variable name "my_printer_icon_png".
